ARCHIVED FILES - Flora's Cakes Website
======================================

This folder contains files from the original template that are not needed
for the Flora's Cakes single-page website but have been archived for
future reference.

ARCHIVED HTML FILES:
-------------------
- aboutus.html, contact.html, gallery.html, services.html, menu.html
- blog.html, blog-single.html, elements.html
- Theme demo pages: birthdaycake.html, chocolate.html, cupcakes.html,
  redvelvet.html, weddingcake.html, blueberry.html, maincolors.html
- index-2.html, favicon.html

These were multi-page template files that are not needed since we
created a single-page website with all content on index.html.

ARCHIVED STYLES:
---------------
Location: _archive/styles/
- birthdaycake.css, blueberry.css, chocolate.css, cupcakes.css
- redvelvet.css, weddingcake.css

These were alternative color scheme CSS files for the template's
demo switcher feature. We're using the maincolors.css scheme only.

ARCHIVED SWITCHER:
-----------------
Location: _archive/switcher/
The entire switcher folder containing the demo color scheme switcher
feature has been archived. This was a demo-only feature for the
template that's not needed in the production website.

ARCHIVED LAYERSLIDER:
--------------------
Location: _archive/vendor/layerslider/
The LayerSlider plugin has been archived as we replaced the slider
with a static hero grid section with service cards.

ACTIVE WEBSITE FILES:
--------------------
The active website now consists of:
- index.html (single-page website)
- css/ folder (including custom-fonts.css, hero-cards.css, reviews-slider.css, smooth-scroll.css)
